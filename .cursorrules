Skelz – Cursor Rules

Scope and intent
- This repo is for a hackathon MVP: decentralized container image registry on Solana.
- Optimize for fast, minimal, demo-ready edits with clear separation of components.

Authoritative context (read first)
- README.md (pitch, MVP scope, tree)
- docs/diagram.md (workflow CI → Cosign → Solana → K8s)
- docs/adrs/0001-architecture-et-choix-tech.md (key choices)

Languages and ownership
- contracts/: Rust (Anchor or plain Solana program)
- cli/: Rust (CLI tool for container operations)
- admission-controller/: Rust (K8s validating webhook using kube-rs)
- sdk/: Rust only (keep thin, focus on core functionality)

Rust-first approach
- Single language for MVP: faster development, easier maintenance
- Use tokio for async runtime across all components
- Leverage existing Rust ecosystem: solana-sdk, anchor, kube-rs, clap
- Shared crates in workspace for common functionality

Coding style
- Prefer clarity over cleverness, small readable functions, strong typing when applicable.
- Follow Conventional Commits and keep diffs minimal/targeted (no drive-by refactors).
- Maintain existing formatting per .editorconfig; do not reformat unrelated code.
- Code, comments, and documentation must be in English (even if discussion is in French).

Edits policy
- Default to minimal edits that achieve the goal; avoid adding infra unless explicitly requested.
- When adding files, also update the nearest README if behavior/usage changes.
- Do not introduce secrets; use .env.example and document required env vars.
- Before changing CI or infra, ask or gate behind a clearly labeled optional step.

Commands and tooling
- Prefer Makefile targets: setup, lint, test, build, e2e. If missing, add narrowly.
- Use pre-commit hooks if present; do not require them to run.
- Use scripts/demo.sh as a placeholder for E2E unless asked to implement.

Tests & lint
- Run make lint and make test where relevant. If not applicable, keep changes buildable and lint-clean.
- If introducing new modules, include at least smoke tests or usage examples.

Security & supply chain
- Never commit private keys or tokens. Point to system keypaths (Cosign, Solana) via env.
- For Cosign, prefer keyless or local keypaths referenced from env variables.

Documentation
- Keep README concise. Put diagrams/specs in docs/.
- If adding public APIs (CLI or SDK), document commands/functions briefly.

Cursor behavior preferences
- Use small, focused edits. Reference exact files and functions.
- If context is missing, ask one clarifying question, then proceed with assumptions stated.
- Avoid massive code dumps. Create files with the minimal scaffolding needed to run.
- Respect .cursorignore; do not surface ignored content.

Acceptance for new work
- Code compiles/builds (where applicable), passes lint, and integrates with existing Makefile targets.
- Includes minimal docs update (README or docs/), no secrets, and a short usage note if user-facing.
